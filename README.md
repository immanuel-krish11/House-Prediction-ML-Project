# House-Prediction-ML-Project
This is a house prediction model which predicts house prices in Bangalore.
The model has an r2-score of 0.86 which is quite good for this model. I've made 4-5 models and out of them, this is the best model(other scores were - 0.6, 0.64,0.69, 0.83).
This is a great example of supervised leraning where the model is trained on labelled data.
This model takes various inputs to predict the prices of the houses at different locations in Bangalore. Inputs like Location, Number of Bedrooms, Number of Bathrooms, Apartment's area in Sq-ft and other details; on the basis of which the model predicts the house prices. The prediction is made in INR in Lakhs.

Tools and libraries used in this model- 
i. Numpy
ii. Pandas
iii. Column Transfer
iv. Pipeline
v. One Hot Encoder
vi. Train-test-split
vii. XGBoost
viii. Simple Imputer
